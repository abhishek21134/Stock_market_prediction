# Stock Price Prediction
This project aims to develop and implement a Python-based machine learning model for stock price 
prediction.<br /> The project utilizes various techniques, including KNN, Auto ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM, for time series forecasting. <br />The goal is to analyze stock price data, extract relevant features, preprocess the data, and train a model that can accurately predict future stock prices.

# Project Highlights
Utilized different techniques for time series forecasting, including KNN, Auto ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM.<br />
Gathered and analyzed historical stock price data to understand patterns and trends.<br />
Extracted relevant features from the data to enhance the model's predictive capabilities.<br />
Conducted data preprocessing steps, such as scaling and normalization, to prepare the data for model training.<br />
Evaluated the performance of the trained models using the root mean squared error (RMSE) metric.<br />
Achieved a low RMSE value of 11.772233, indicating the model's effectiveness in predicting stock prices.<br />
