# Stock Price Prediction
This project aims to develop and implement a Python-based machine learning model for stock price prediction. The project utilizes various techniques, including KNN, Auto ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM, for time series forecasting. The goal is to analyze stock price data, extract relevant features, preprocess the data, and train a model that can accurately predict future stock prices.

# Project Highlights
Utilized different techniques for time series forecasting, including KNN, Auto ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM.
Gathered and analyzed historical stock price data to understand patterns and trends.
Extracted relevant features from the data to enhance the model's predictive capabilities.
Conducted data preprocessing steps, such as scaling and normalization, to prepare the data for model training.
Evaluated the performance of the trained models using the root mean squared error (RMSE) metric.
Achieved a low RMSE value of 11.772233, indicating the model's effectiveness in predicting stock prices.
